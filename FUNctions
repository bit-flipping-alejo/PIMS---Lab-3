# Lab 3 Picture Manipulation Functions

# ============================================================

# Start by making a couple functions to reduce code repeats
# Prompt the user to select a file, returns image data
def get_pic():
  return makePicture(pickAFile())
  

# Problem 1

# function requires a parameter of an percentage integer.
def lessRed(p):
  # convert integer to decimal version of percentage
  p = p/100.0
  # save data passed from function
  pic = get_pic()
  pixels = getPixels(pic)
  # for each pixel, save red value. Then reduce the value of red by user inputted percentage
  for x in pixels:
    r = getRed(x)
    setRed(x, r*p)
  # output the edited picture to the screen
  repaint(pic)
  
def halfRed():
  # prompt user for percentage
  percentage = input("From 0-100, what percentage do you wish to reduce the red pixel value: ")
  # modifty picture
  lessRed(percentage)
  # output picture
  repaint(pic)

# Problem 2
def moreRed():
  pic = get_pic()
  pixels = getPixels(pic)
  percentage = input("From 0-100, what percentage do you wish to increase the red pixel value: ")
  p = 1+(percentage/100)
  for x in pixels:
    r = getRed(x)
    newRed = r*p
    if newRed > 255:
      setRed(x, 255)
    else:
      setRed(x, newRed)
  repaint(pic)
    
# Problem 3
def roseColoredGlasses():
  pic = get_pic()
  pixels = getPixels(pic)
  #for x in picPixels
    
# Problem 4

def lightenUp():
  # get picture and save pixel data
  pic = get_pic()
  pixels = getPixels(pic)
  #lighten each pixel
  for x in pixels:
    oldColor = getColor(x)
    newColor = makeLighter(oldColor)
    setColor(x, newColor)
  # output
  repaint(pic)
  
# Problem 5
